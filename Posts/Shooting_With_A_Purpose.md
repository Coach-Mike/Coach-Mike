# Shooting With A Purose

Everyone wants to score goals. Therefore, it might be useful to understand how to score goals. If we agree that in order to score goals, you must beat the goalie, simple logic will lead us to search for situations that are difficult for goalies to save the puck. Finding these situations, named "scoring chances", will help us create them during the game and score more goals! J

At OneIce Hocke Academy, we follow the framework described by Scott McMillan in his paper "Shooting With A Purpose In Ice Hockey" - https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e3de/533ac1d46373c5e339bb01c5ef414c0afa94.pdf

1st we create an understanding with our players that you always shoot with a purpose (never shoot to shoot), than we teach that some situations invite you to "shoot to score" while others invite you to shoot "to create a shooting chance for a teammate".

**"Shoot To Score" Situations**  

1. Shot from the house – most goals in the game are scored from here 

2. Shoot to score after a pass from high2low or low2high – shoot quick so goalie is not ready

3. Shoot to score after a pass from strong-side2week-side - shoot quick so goalie is not ready

*McMillan describes statistics regarding the location on the ice goals are scored from and where in the net pucks are scored in support of these "Shoot To Score" situations
