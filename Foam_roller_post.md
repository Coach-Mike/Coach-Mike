# The Foam Roller

Foam rollers are easy-to-use fitness tools that can soothe pain, quicken recovery from exercise, and reduce injury, this introduction to a recent [Harvard study](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/roll-away-muscle-pain).

The foam roller allows for deep compression which helps to break up or relax tight muscles and adhesions formed between muscle layers and their surroundings. Imagine you are tenderizing your own muscles. They should be soft and supple like a baby’s muscles. However, if our muscles are not taken care of properly we can experience loss of flexibility, adhesions, and painful movement.
 
The deep compression of self-myofascial release allows normal blood flow to return and the restoration of healthy tissue. The body naturally wants to be healthy and strong, but sometimes an extra boost is needed to achieve optimal muscle and tissue health.
